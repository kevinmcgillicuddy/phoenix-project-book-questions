### [The Phoenix Project Book](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) Discussion Questions

---
Group book discussion questions for small to mid-sized companies. Some borrowed from [here](https://gist.github.com/CharlesTBetz/6ca4f136fb0e48b4b9c2c1aec880ae66). Ideally would take on 3 chapters a month and start with a recap of the chapters each time then lead into discussion questions

- What cultural things did you note in these chapters that we are trying to do differently at here at our company?
  - "We've had so many problems with this particular upload," she says frustrated, "that IT gave us a program that we use to do manual corrections, so we don't have to bother them anymore."
  - "I'm being kept in the dark as usual"
  - "they never follow the process, it always causes problems"
  - "Situations like this only reinforce deep suspicions of developers: they're often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving ops to clean up the mess"

- How valued do you think the IT staff feels and why? 
- Brent said they were meaning to update the SAN's firmware for years, but never got around to it and suspect that is what caused the failure. Do you think there is anything like that at our company?  What can cause 'never getting to it'?
- What are your thoughts on this statement "everyone thinks that the real way to get work done is to just do it"

### Chapters 4 - 6 
- At the beginning of Chapter 4, we start to hear about conflicts between Development and Operations. Have you had any life experiences where two groups did not get along (work, school, community).
- Has there been a system or product you helped put in place, but it has been ignored and therefore you feel more reluctant to taking on new solutions that come about to solve the same problem you feel like you already did? (Patty's Experience). How do you overcome that?
- Can you think of an "all hands on deck" moment that we have had that may have been circumvented with better planning?
- Chapter 6: Change management. They can’t agree on what a change is. What do you think of their definition? How would you define a change?
- Bill references the movie Saving Private Ryan when he says, "There's a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down. Always up." Thoughts on this?

### Chapters 7 - 9 
- Chapter 8: Have you ever had too much work in your backlog? How have you dealt with it? How do we as a team deal with it?
- In chapter 8, Patty says, "For messy middle changes" we're deciding that the change submitter has responsibility and accountability for consulting and getting approval from people potentially affected." How do you see this working currently and do you feel it is effective?
- Are there changes you are aware are happening that should be scheduled and then implemented that are not currently?
- What do you think of how to think about work in 4 types (Changes, Business Projects, IT Projects, Unplanned work)?

- How does the benefits of a CAB board look like for smaller IT departments, 30 people or less
- Who, if anyone, considers if IT projects support business projects?
- "You need to control work into the department to control work in progress." How is this possible for your situation? 
- What is the difference between business projects and IT projects
- How do the Three Ways of DevOps, which are "Fast flow, Feedback, Learning" scale to a mid sized company?

### Chapters 10 - 12 
- Chapter 10. Have you ever met a Brent? (In any area of life, not just tech.) Or found yourself being one?
- Chapter 11. Have you ever been in a situation where work in process was out of control? Explain or describe. How did you address it?
- Has there ever been a time where you feared that if you didn't hold the all the knowledge, it made you easier to let go?

### Chapters 13 - 15 
- Have you ever been a part of an ongoing crisis or intense work effort where you were asked to be active for extended periods? What happened? How did it affect you?
- Chapter 14. Outsourcing IT. What do you think of this as a strategy, given what they have just gone through with the Phoenix launch?
- "When we say something they saw or heard that was "so easy" is not possible, then run to another sales guy or outsource firm that says they will do it." Can you relate to this quote and what perceptions need to change with those outside of IT
- Chapter 15. Think about “unplanned work.” What in your life can you relate this to (examples of situations that came out of nowhere)?
- Have you heard of the "Free Puppy Syndrome" mentioned in the book? - it's not upfront cost it’s the ongoing cost /upkeep that kills you. Do you have examples of this in your workplace?
- If key job is prevent unplanned work, what are some ways to stop or limit unplanned work
- Why is it important to the First Way of Devops that IT work is visualized
   - helps identify too much work in progress or a resource being over used
- "Being able to take needless work out of the system is just as important as controlling work in." What does your IT team do to engage what is important to the company at large?
- Are you able to identifiy your constrainst in finishing tasks with your department? What does releasing new projects or work at the rate of the constraint mean or look like for your team?

### Chapters 16 - 18
- "IT matters. IT is not just a department I can delegate away. IT is smack in the middle of every major company effort we have and is critical to almost every aspect of daily operations. Its leadership and how its performing is critical." Do you think this rings true for your deparment and your team's mindset?

    - Why would you need to be vulnerable to attain mutual trust? 
     - Is trust deeper than just competance?
- Part of issue is that development is not aware of what is needed from Operations. For smaller IT deparments, what would it look like to list out needs and resources before starting work?
- Technical Debt - unplanned work caused by applications in production, which cause short cuts to be taken in new applications which leads to more unplanned work. All work is used to keeping old systems alive. This is all time spent fire fighting it is a death march - firefighting leads to shortcuts which leads to more unplanned work and fragile systems
    - Can you identify what is causing you a large amount of technical debt?

### Chapters 19 - 21
- What is your/our definition of a 'completed project' - where may varying definitions have bit us?
- In Chapter 19 it talks about the process the plant floor uses to determine if they can take on more work. Bill observes, "I’m pretty sure we (IT) don’t do any sort of analysis of capacity and demand before we accept work." What would an IT analysis of capacity look like, and what do you need to know to do it? 
an you think of a time when planned work had to be cut due to unplanned work? 
- Can you think of a time when planned work had to be cut due to unplanned work?
- Bill asks, "how does anyone decide what needs to get worked on" and Wes responds with, "we trust people to make the right decision based on the data they have. That's why we hire smart people." What are potential issues that can come from this way of thinking? 
  - Bill replies with "and on what data do our smart people base their prioritization decisions?" 
  - On what data do you prioritize planned work effectively while protecting time for unplanned work? 
- In Chapter 20 Consider the statement, ‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ Do you agree? Disagree? Any examples?
- Do you agree with this statement as it applied to IT? "Elevating maintenance is the most important thing we can do to ensure machine availablity. This reduces unplanned work (Total Productive Maintence program TPM) and Lean community use this method"
- What methods or frameworks can be used to ensure IT securtiy policies and tasks are tied to actual risks the business needs to treat?
- What do you think of these 3 questions to ask about a project before accepting it?
  - Will it increase flow of project work through IT?
  - Will it increase stability or decrease time required to detect and recover from outage or security breach?
  - Will it increase capacity of a team or worker?
- How does the quote from Erik "When a resource is 99% utilized, you have to wait 99 times as long as if that resource is 50% utilized" impact scheduled for IT teams? Do you agree with his quote?
- Consider the statement, ‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ Do you agree? Disagree? Any examples?
- Brent on page 209 is described as a 'worker supporting too many work centers.' Why is this view better than Bill's initial of saying Brent was the constrained work center?
